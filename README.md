# My Journey Through Learning Python
The primary purpose of this repository is to document my process of learning Python. 

Within ../Modules there is a folder named PythonRepo. This folder houses each of my Python scripts. 
Each of these scripts is named to reflect the concept it demonstrates - "hello_world.py" does as it describes, etc.
